##  The Meaning Behind Our Team Name‚öîÔ∏è

Our team name, **DOJO'S KATANAS,** is a tribute to our journey and training. We are students of [sheryians](https://sheryians.com/), where the classrooms are known as **DOJO**. Just as a dojo is a place of learning and discipline, we have honed our skills and knowledge within the [sheryians](https://sheryians.com/). The **Katana**, a revered sword, symbolizes our precision, strength, and dedication. We consider ourselves the **katana swords of the DOJO**, ready to cut through challenges with skill and finesse. It is noteworthy that while the katana is a powerful symbol, it is **not legal** in India, further emphasizing its representation as a metaphor for our sharpness and capability.
